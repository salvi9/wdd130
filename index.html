      Around the world, people are celebrating the Chinese New Year and the
      start to the Year of the Dragon. This got us wondering: Where did the myth
      of the dragon come from in the first place? <strong>Scholars say that belief in
      dragons probably evolved independently in both Europe and China, and
      perhaps in the Americas and Australia as well.</strong> How could this happen? Many
      have speculated about which <em>real-life</em> animals inspired the first legends.
